# Description:
To-Do List is a simple task list based on JavaScript. Write in it all your important affairs, so as not to forget. To-Do List will allow you to efficiently organize your working time. Everything can be written into it: from the shopping list to important business meetings. [Demo](https://maksymchak.github.io/todolist)
